I was interviewed by [WSB reporter Richard Belcher](http://www.wsbtv.com/richard-belcher) about IT infrastructure concerns at MARTA. In this interview, we talked about the excessive amount of time MARTA claims it needs to complete the RFP process.

You can see the most recent interview [here](http://www.wsbtv.com/video?videoId=704630160&videoVersion=1.0). Prior interviews with Mr. Belcher can also be located elsewhere in this blog.

MARTA has been an ongoing concern with Mr. Belcher, and with good reason. A 2015 report from Fujitsu showed critical IT infrastructure-related issues present, which have yet to be fully addressed. Fujitsu raised concerns about the very real possibility of catastrophic failures, which would effectively bring MARTA operations to a halt.
