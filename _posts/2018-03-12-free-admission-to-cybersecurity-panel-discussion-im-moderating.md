So, I've fooled the good folks at [TiE Atlanta](http://atlanta.tie.org/) into thinking I'm smart enough to moderate a panel discussion on cybersecurity!

The event is set for Wednesday, 3/14, from 6:00pm - 8:30pm. It is being held at Roam Perimeter Center, 1151 Hammond Drive, Atlanta. Directions can be found [here.](https://www.google.com/maps/@33.919548,-84.3448637,17z?hl=en;z%3D14)

The panel has some really good folks set to participate, and their job is to make me look as good as possible by giving us all some thoughtful answers to various topics and questions. Panel members are:

  * Sanket Patel - CEO of Securolytics
  * Phil Hill - Information Security Engineer, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
  * Martin Fisher - Manager, IT Security, Northside Hospital ([@armorguy](https://twitter.com/armorguy) on Twitter)



The event is free to TiE members, but $35 for non-members. However, TiE has been nice enough to give me an unlimited number of free passes to the event. The catch is that you have to register ahead of time. To do so, visit <https://goo.gl/bNJ5mp> and use the code "**VIP** " to register for a free ticket.

Hope to see you there, please feel free to reach out and say hello if make it out!
