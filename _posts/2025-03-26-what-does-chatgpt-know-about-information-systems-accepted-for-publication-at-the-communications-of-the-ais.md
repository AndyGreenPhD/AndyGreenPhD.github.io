I recently worked on a research project with [Dan O’Leary](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/daniel-edmund-oleary), [Veda Storey](https://robinson.gsu.edu/profile/veda-c-storey/), [Aaron French](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-french/), [Joseph Buckman](https://robinson.gsu.edu/profile/joseph-buckman/), [Cecil Chua](https://works.bepress.com/cecil-chua/about/), [Grace Gu](https://www.graceyuangu.com/), [Fred Niederman](https://www.slu.edu/business/about/faculty/niederman-fred.php), [Francis Pereira](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/francis-pereira), [Gary Templeton](https://business.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/directory/profile?pid=3499), and [Linda Wallace](https://acis.pamplin.vt.edu/directory/Wallace.html) that explored how well ChatGPT would do with exam and quiz questions used by faculty in Information Systems (IS) courses. I’m happy to report that our work has been accepted for publication in the Communications of the AIS.

The study found that generative AI tools like ChatGPT performed well on actual exams and quizzes in general IS courses, database management, systems analysis and design, project management, and cybersecurity. ChatGPT earned a B average with multiple-choice and true/false questions and an A average on short answer/essay questions.

We recommend that academia look at ways to implement AI tools in the classroom so that students can be prepared for their use in the workplace, rather than prohibiting their use. It’s our job to ensure that students are well prepared when they graduate, and AI is just the latest innovation we must incorporate into our teaching.
