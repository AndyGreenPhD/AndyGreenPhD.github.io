[Senator Bruce Thompson](http://www.senate.ga.gov/senators/en-US/member.aspx?Member=844), one of the sponsors of SB 315, recently introduced a resolution to form a joint study committee to examine cyber security issues.

The resolution, which can be read at <http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20172018/SR/929> seeks to form a joint study committee between the Georgia House and Senate. The resolution calls for four Representatives and four Senators to be selected to serve on the committee, with each body selecting a co-chair from among their respective four members.

Of particular interest, the resolution also calls for the Senate and the House to select a citizen member of the committee. The resolution states that the citizen members must be knowledgable in cyber security and policy. The committee, which will expire on December 1, 2018, is tasked with producing a report on their findings and reporting back to their respective bodies.

Over the weekend, I participated in a conference call where this resolution was discussed. One of the participants on the call who is well-versed in the machinations of the Georgia political scene, described the proposed resolution as a sign that SB 315 may be in trouble, and will not pass the House.

While this may actually be the case, nothing is certain until the legislative session ends with SB 315 not being passed, so I am still very much in a "wait and see" position.

Whether or not this new resolution is a sign of SB 315's impending defeat, I am very happy to see a joint study committee being proposed, even if it is short-term in nature. Georgia, like every other state, faces real issues and challenges with regards to cyber security. I welcome the proposal of this committee as a sign that our legislators understand the seriousness of the issues, and displays a willingness to learn more about them prior to passing any future legislation.
