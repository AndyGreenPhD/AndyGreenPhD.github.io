I recently participated as a speaker for Kennesaw State University’s Cybersecurity Awareness Day program (<https://cybersecurity.kennesaw.edu/docs/csa-day-oct-6-2020.pdf>). My topic was security, privacy, and public policy issues related to Higher Education usage of contact tracing apps.

I’ve posted my slide deck as a PDF [here]</assets/pdf/2020-10-06-covid-19-tracing-apps-security-privacy-and-public-policy-issues-for-higher-education.pdf>, in case anyone is interested in seeing them.
