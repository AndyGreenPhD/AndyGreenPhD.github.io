My research-in-progress submission on the risks organizations face from executives’ use of their private social media sites (SNS) was selected for presentation at the 2018 Workshop on Information Security and Privacy (WISP).

The workshop was sponsored by the AIS Special Interest Group on Information Security and Privacy (SIGSEC), and held in conjunction with the 2018 International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), in San Francisco.

The presentation was an excerpt of my dissertation proposal, and I’m happy to say that I received positive feedback from the audience during my talk.
