So, I have been a distant admirer of Ming Chow’s ([@0xmchow](https://twitter.com/0xmchow)) [password cracking labs](https://mchow01.github.io/education/security/2018/11/10/password-cracking.html) for his students.  Each semester, I found myself thinking “green, you need to do this sometime…” but never quite got around to doing it.

Until now…  🙂

This semester, I created a list of accounts and passwords and gave it to students in all of my security classes, as an extra credit assignment.  Details can be found at <https://github.com/AndyGreenPhD/password_cracking_challenges>

Students were given a list of 20 passwords to try and crack.  The answers were as follows, along with the number of times the password was cracked:

|Hash   |Username       |Password       |Count |
