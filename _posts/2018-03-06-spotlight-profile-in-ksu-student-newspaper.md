For reasons that I don't fully understand, someone at the student newspaper thought I was interesting enough to warrant a spotlight article in this week's publication.

While the article is nice, I'm most happy about the display of solid drumming technique I display in the picture! 😂😂

I am truly a lucky guy. Not many people get to do what they want to do as a career, and for that I am immensely grateful. Even on my worst days, I never forget that I've got a damned good gig.
