I was recently interviewed by AP news reporter R.J. Rico for an article about SB 315.

The article can be read [here](https://apnews.com/8460069f254d4bb4bcc0d0d932d7eb95/Sweeping-Georgia-cybercrime-bill-would-target-'snoopers').

According to the article, the University System of Georgia had input on the bill but has not taken a position. I have had conversations with two different KSU administrators about this bill, and was told that the bill had been discussed at a recent meeting of the President's cabinet.

At the time, I was hopeful that the university or the USG would take an official position on the merits of the bill. However, since that time I have twice emailed the same KSU administrators I had previously had conversations with, but never received a response from either of them.
