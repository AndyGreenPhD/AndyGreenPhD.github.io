Hopefully, it will survive the session and be ready for next year.</p> <p>I believe this is a very good move for the state, and I hope it passes next year and is signed into law by the governor. A 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study recommended the use of hand-marked paper ballots for voting, as did Dr. Wenke Lee, the sole security member of a 2019 Georgia panel created to examine election security.</p> <p>hand-marked paper ballots are the safest and most secure way to ensure that a voter’s intent is counted as intended and provide a clean method for post-election audits (hopefully using the risk-limiting audit method).</p> <p>AJC reporting – <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-lawmakers-propose-switch-to-hand-marked-paper-ballots/WFF4W34YCJEBPNMIEPODCMFGWM/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0nLbIt23T8h2y7zTCy_-SOTLIZABxbMmsspc3LJRRwz20Z8OZiEux1x5M_aem_3bzzfM47-eKz8LI78tmUeg">https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-lawmakers-propose-switch-to-hand-marked-paper-ballots/WFF4W34YCJEBPNMIEPODCMFGWM/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0nLbIt23T8h2y7zTCy_-SOTLIZABxbMmsspc3LJRRwz20Z8OZiEux1x5M_aem_3bzzfM47-eKz8LI78tmUeg</a></p> <p>Senate Bill 214 text – <a href="https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20252026/233014?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR21Ov5iwZLFeefwyNWpl7o8Qz_o4tICq-Z7uinQ_avlkocS4dYUcc3Kw6U_aem_V2FpMdWycNEFdSkRxUeJCQ">https://www.legis.ga.gov/api/legislation/document/20252026/233014?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR21Ov5iwZLFeefwyNWpl7o8Qz_o4tICq-Z7uinQ_avlkocS4dYUcc3Kw6U_aem_V2FpMdWycNEFdSkRxUeJCQ</a></p> <p>2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study on election security – <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25120/chapter/1">https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25120/chapter/1</a></p> <p>LinkedIn post from Dr. Wenke Lee on why he supports the use of hand-marked paper ballots – <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-computer-scientists-prefer-paper-ballots-wenke-lee/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-computer-scientists-prefer-paper-ballots-wenke-lee/</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Analysis,"/><category term="Legislation"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Georgia Assembly is considering a bill to return the state to hand-marked paper ballots as the default, with touchscreen voting devices available for people with disabilities.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“What does ChatGPT Know about Information Systems?” accepted for publication at the Communications of the AIS</title><link href="https://andygreenphd.github.io/blog/2025/what-does-chatgpt-know-about-information-systems-accepted-for-publication-at-the-communications-of-the-ais/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“What does ChatGPT Know about Information Systems?” accepted for publication at the Communications of the AIS"/><published>2025-03-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://andygreenphd.github.io/blog/2025/what-does-chatgpt-know-about-information-systems-accepted-for-publication-at-the-communications-of-the-ais</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://andygreenphd.github.io/blog/2025/what-does-chatgpt-know-about-information-systems-accepted-for-publication-at-the-communications-of-the-ais/"><![CDATA[<p>I recently worked on a research project with <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/daniel-edmund-oleary">Dan O’Leary</a>, <a href="https://robinson.gsu.edu/profile/veda-c-storey/">Veda Storey</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-french/">Aaron French</a>, <a href="https://robinson.gsu.edu/profile/joseph-buckman/">Joseph Buckman</a>, <a href="https://works.bepress.com/cecil-chua/about/">Cecil Chua</a>, <a href="https://www.graceyuangu.com/">Grace Gu</a>, <a href="https://www.slu.edu/business/about/faculty/niederman-fred.php">Fred Niederman</a>, <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/francis-pereira">Francis Pereira</a>, <a href="https://business.wvu.edu/faculty-and-staff/directory/profile?pid=3499">Gary Templeton</a>, and <a href="https://acis.pamplin.vt.edu/directory/Wallace.html">Linda Wallace</a> that explored how well ChatGPT would do with exam and quiz questions used by faculty in Information Systems (IS) courses. I’m happy to report that our work has been accepted for publication in the Communications of the AIS.</p> <p>The study found that generative AI tools like ChatGPT performed well on actual exams and quizzes in general IS courses, database management, systems analysis and design, project management, and cybersecurity. ChatGPT earned a B average with multiple-choice and true/false questions and an A average on short answer/essay questions.</p> <p>We recommend that academia look at ways to implement AI tools in the classroom so that students can be prepared for their use in the workplace, rather than prohibiting their use. It’s our job to ensure that students are well prepared when they graduate, and AI is just the latest innovation we must incorporate into our teaching.</p> <p>The article is available for download at (https://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol56/iss1/19/)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Academia,"/><category term="Research,"/><category term="Students"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently worked on a research project with Dan O’Leary, Veda Storey, Aaron French, Joseph Buckman, Cecil Chua, Grace Gu, Fred Niederman, Francis Pereira, Gary Templeton, and Linda Wallace that explored how well ChatGPT would do with exam and quiz questions used by faculty in Information Systems (IS) courses.
