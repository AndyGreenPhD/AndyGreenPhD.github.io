## Disclaimer

This is my personal blog. The opinions expressed here represent my own and not those of my employer, or any group or organization I may be affiliated with.

And now, this section is shamelessly stolen from [https://sampleblogdisclaimer.blogspot.com/2016/11/fun-disclaimer-sample-for-personal-blog.html](https://sampleblogdisclaimer.blogspot.com/2016/11/fun-disclaimer-sample-for-personal-blog.html) because I like it, and also represents how I feel about the things I write here :

It is not a peer-reviewed journal, a final archive of my writing, a sponsored publication, or the product of gatekeeping and editing. That does mean something…it means that while the ideas and thoughts are often vital and the product of a long gestational period, the writing itself is not. It is essentially as it came from the keyboard: spontaneous, unproofed, unrevised, and corrected afterward only when necessary to address mistakes that grossly effect the intent. Where such changes have been made they are explicitly noted.
