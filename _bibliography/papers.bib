  abstract={The financial and national security impacts of cybercrime globally are well documented. According to the 2020 FBI Internet Crime Report, financially motivated threat actors committed 86% of reported breaches, resulting in a total loss of approximately $4.1 billion in the United States alone (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2022). In order to combat this, our research seeks to determine if threat actors change their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on the geolocation of their target’s IP address. To answer this research question, we will construct a honeypot network distributed across multiple continents to collect attack data from geographically separate locations concurrently. We will configure the honeypots to offer vulnerable services and collect log data from the services for analysis. This approach will allow us to aggregate log data about attacks against specific services commonly targeted by threat actors. After we complete data collection, we will analyze the data to gain insight into the TTPs used by the threat actors. The analysis will use collected attack data attributes such as IP origin, service type, and executables delivered along with other transport layer analysis techniques to provide metadata on threat actor TTPs. Once the analysis is complete, we will have a greater insight into threat actor activities and produce a list of items that firms can use to monitor, protect, and maintain their environments and to detect attacks earlier, along with taking appropriate defensive action to lessen or eliminate the risk associated with these attacks.},

  abstract={Based on industry use cases, we identify six distinct types of digital transformation (DT), each grounded in a specific concept or enabling technology. These DT types can be implemented individually or combined to drive transformation initiatives. While deploying a single DT type often focuses on improving operational efficiency or streamlining existing workflows, initiatives that combine multiple DT types tend to pursue more ambitious goals, such as the creation of new products, services, or business models. However, the complexity increases signifi­ cantly with the integration of multiple DT types, as organizations must not only address behavioral changes but also overcome technical challenges involving systems integration, data architecture, and interoperability.},

  abstract={Large language models such as ChatGPT provide efficient access to a wealth of information. However, there are significant questions regarding the depth and quality of knowledge in any one domain. This paper focuses specifically on the information systems (IS) field and assesses ChatGPT’s knowledge. To analyze the extent and quality of information systems knowledge derived from queries to ChatGPT, we used over 3,000 queries from a broad range of exam and quiz questions. These queries were obtained from university courses and professional information system certification exams. The query topics are based on a framework for information systems education, with queries gathered from multiple faculty members at different universities. The results of querying ChatGPT with these questions find that ChatGPT can answer 65% to 85% of information systems queries successfully, across each of the areas of the framework. ChatGPT performed well on essay, true/false and multiple choice questions, with no statistical difference between its success rate on multiple choice and true/false questions. We conclude that ChatGPT tends to perform approximately at the level of an average student, but may not perform at a level sufficient to pass certain professional exams. ChatGPT’s knowledge is very broad, covering virtually all areas of the information systems knowledge we identified, but not at an expert level.},

  abstract={Vulnerability researchers face difficult choices when considering whether to reporting a finding to an organization with which they are unaffiliated. We used components of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to create the Vulnerability Discovery and Disclosure (VDD) model to understand the decision-making processes of vulnerability researchers. PMT uses high fear appeals, threat appraisals, and coping appraisals to encourage employee prosocial behaviors while VDD proposes low fear and threat with high coping, to encourage reporting. In this exploratory study, we surveyed active vulnerability researchers to gain insight into their concerns when deciding to report to an organization. Using principal components analysis, we developed and refined the VDD survey, which may be tested by future researchers. We also discovered a higher-order efficacy construct, comprised of response and self-efficacy. We theorize that well-developed vulnerability disclosure policies, in line with a low-fear, low-threat appraisal and high efficacy may establish a culture of trust between organizations and vulnerability researchers, encouraging more reports.},

  abstract={U.S. emergency alert systems (EAS) run on legacy software with aging hardware and limited cybersecurity. While EASs are an essential component of the U.S. critical infrastructure, they are often under-funded, and workers frequently lack the knowledge to protect these systems adequately. Recent compromises of various EASs have not inspired public conﬁdence. We present a method for EAS authorities to engage with external cybersecurity researchers to ﬁnd, recover from, and disclose vulnerabilities using coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) policies. Clearly written CVD policies set guidelines and legal bounds for cybersecurity research, taking advantage of researcher expertise while working to strengthen the cybersecurity of the patchwork public-private-government networks comprising EASs. We intended to investigate the CVD policies of EASs in seven southeastern states; however, we could ﬁnd no CVD policies through the entire supply chain. Instead, we investigated the CVD policies of the top 10 technology ﬁrms on the Fortune 500 list, analyzing best practices in terms of publication of a CVD policy, as well as: setting eligibility requirements, describing the submission process, delineating researcher restrictions, outlining agreements on sharing credit, and explaining bounties (if relevant). We recommend that EAS authorities develop CVD policies in line with suggested criteria, using policies from top technology organizations combined with the proposed framework, and using cybersecurity researchers as a valuable component of the EAS supply chain.},

  abstract={U.S. emergency alert systems (EASs) are part of the nation's critical infrastructure. These systems are built on aging platforms and suffer from a fragmented interconnected network of partnerships. Some EASs have an easily identifiable vulnerability - their management website is available via the Internet. Authorities must secure these systems quickly. Other concerns exist, primarily the lack of policies for reporting vulnerabilities. To begin an assessment of U.S. EASs, we used Shodan to evaluate the availability of these websites in six southeastern states. We found 18 such websites that  were  accessible  via  the  Internet,  only  requiring  user  credentials  to  login  to  the  system.  Next,  we  searched  for published policies on the reporting of vulnerabilities; we found no vulnerability disclosure policies for any of the systems identified.  To  identify,  prioritize,  and  address  EAS  vulnerabilities,  we  present  a  list  of  technical  and  management strategies to reduce cybersecurity threats. We recommend integrated policies and procedures at all levels of the public-private-government  partnerships,  along  with  system  resilience,  as  lines  of  defense  against  cybersecurity  threats.  By implementing  these  strategies,  U.S.  EASs  will  be  positioned  to  update  critical  infrastructure,  notify  groups  of emergencies, and ensure the distribution of valid and reliable information to the populations at risk.},

For this exploratory research project, we surveyed 11 judges and mentors participating in a well-established high school CDC held in the southeastern United States. Then we developed a set of recommended learning outcomes for CDCs, based on importance of the topic and participant preparedness for future information-security related endeavors. While most previous research has focused on technology issues, we analyzed technological, human, and social topics, to develop a comprehensive set of recommendations for future CDCs. },
