  abstract={Based on industry use cases, we identify six distinct types of digital transformation (DT), each grounded in a specific concept or enabling technology. These DT types can be implemented individually or combined to drive transformation initiatives. While deploying a single DT type often focuses on improving operational efficiency or streamlining existing workflows, initiatives that combine multiple DT types tend to pursue more ambitious goals, such as the creation of new products, services, or business models. However, the complexity increases signifi­ cantly with the integration of multiple DT types, as organizations must not only address behavioral changes but also overcome technical challenges involving systems integration, data architecture, and interoperability.},

  abstract={Large language models such as ChatGPT provide efficient access to a wealth of information. However, there are significant questions regarding the depth and quality of knowledge in any one domain. This paper focuses specifically on the information systems (IS) field and assesses ChatGPT’s knowledge. To analyze the extent and quality of information systems knowledge derived from queries to ChatGPT, we used over 3,000 queries from a broad range of exam and quiz questions. These queries were obtained from university courses and professional information system certification exams. The query topics are based on a framework for information systems education, with queries gathered from multiple faculty members at different universities. The results of querying ChatGPT with these questions find that ChatGPT can answer 65% to 85% of information systems queries successfully, across each of the areas of the framework. ChatGPT performed well on essay, true/false and multiple choice questions, with no statistical difference between its success rate on multiple choice and true/false questions. We conclude that ChatGPT tends to perform approximately at the level of an average student, but may not perform at a level sufficient to pass certain professional exams. ChatGPT’s knowledge is very broad, covering virtually all areas of the information systems knowledge we identified, but not at an expert level.},

  title={Principles of Network Security},
  author={Green, Andrew William and Whitman, Michael E. and Mattord, Herbert},
  year={2024},
  publisher={Kendall Hunt Publishing},
  isbn={979-8-3851-3043-6},
  abstract={Principles of Network Security offers a comprehensive, approachable, and up-to-date foundation for teaching network security to students in high school, trade school, or college-level courses. This textbook introduces core concepts in network security, cryptography, secure architecture, threat analysis, and monitoring while addressing modern challenges like IoT, cloud security, AI, and Zero Trust frameworks. Each chapter combines foundational theory with real-world examples and current best practices.  The book emphasizes practical knowledge across layered topics, from the OSI and TCP/IP models and data communication protocols to firewall configuration, VPN deployments, wireless network protections, and access control models. It includes coverage of leading standards and frameworks from NIST, CIS, and ISO. Rich pedagogical features - such as learning objectives, review questions, hands-on exercises, and short projects - help reinforce key skills and prepare students for further study or entry into cybersecurity roles.  Whether used in a semester-long survey or as a base for certification pathways, this textbook equips students with the knowledge they need to navigate the complexities of modern network security.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
