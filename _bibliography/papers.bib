  abstract={Based on industry use cases, we identify six distinct types of digital transformation (DT), each grounded in a specific concept or enabling technology. These DT types can be implemented individually or combined to drive transformation initiatives. While deploying a single DT type often focuses on improving operational efficiency or streamlining existing workflows, initiatives that combine multiple DT types tend to pursue more ambitious goals, such as the creation of new products, services, or business models. However, the complexity increases signifi­ cantly with the integration of multiple DT types, as organizations must not only address behavioral changes but also overcome technical challenges involving systems integration, data architecture, and interoperability.},

  abstract={Large language models such as ChatGPT provide efficient access to a wealth of information. However, there are significant questions regarding the depth and quality of knowledge in any one domain. This paper focuses specifically on the information systems (IS) field and assesses ChatGPT’s knowledge. To analyze the extent and quality of information systems knowledge derived from queries to ChatGPT, we used over 3,000 queries from a broad range of exam and quiz questions. These queries were obtained from university courses and professional information system certification exams. The query topics are based on a framework for information systems education, with queries gathered from multiple faculty members at different universities. The results of querying ChatGPT with these questions find that ChatGPT can answer 65% to 85% of information systems queries successfully, across each of the areas of the framework. ChatGPT performed well on essay, true/false and multiple choice questions, with no statistical difference between its success rate on multiple choice and true/false questions. We conclude that ChatGPT tends to perform approximately at the level of an average student, but may not perform at a level sufficient to pass certain professional exams. ChatGPT’s knowledge is very broad, covering virtually all areas of the information systems knowledge we identified, but not at an expert level.},

  author={Green, Andrew William and Whitman, Michael E. and Mattord, Herbert},
  year={2024},
  publisher={Kendall Hunt Publishing},
  isbn={979-8-3851-3043-6},
  abstract={Principles of Network Security offers a comprehensive, approachable, and up-to-date foundation for teaching network security to students in high school, trade school, or college-level courses. This textbook introduces core concepts in network security, cryptography, secure architecture, threat analysis, and monitoring while addressing modern challenges like IoT, cloud security, AI, and Zero Trust frameworks. Each chapter combines foundational theory with real-world examples and current best practices.  The book emphasizes practical knowledge across layered topics, from the OSI and TCP/IP models and data communication protocols to firewall configuration, VPN deployments, wireless network protections, and access control models. It includes coverage of leading standards and frameworks from NIST, CIS, and ISO. Rich pedagogical features - such as learning objectives, review questions, hands-on exercises, and short projects - help reinforce key skills and prepare students for further study or entry into cybersecurity roles.  Whether used in a semester-long survey or as a base for certification pathways, this textbook equips students with the knowledge they need to navigate the complexities of modern network security.},

  abstract={Vulnerability researchers face difficult choices when considering whether to reporting a finding to an organization with which they are unaffiliated. We used components of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to create the Vulnerability Discovery and Disclosure (VDD) model to understand the decision-making processes of vulnerability researchers. PMT uses high fear appeals, threat appraisals, and coping appraisals to encourage employee prosocial behaviors while VDD proposes low fear and threat with high coping, to encourage reporting. In this exploratory study, we surveyed active vulnerability researchers to gain insight into their concerns when deciding to report to an organization. Using principal components analysis, we developed and refined the VDD survey, which may be tested by future researchers. We also discovered a higher-order efficacy construct, comprised of response and self-efficacy. We theorize that well-developed vulnerability disclosure policies, in line with a low-fear, low-threat appraisal and high efficacy may establish a culture of trust between organizations and vulnerability researchers, encouraging more reports.},

We replicate a study evaluating the relationship of continued-use intention to the success of social networking sites to determine whether the results obtained with a US sample can be generalized to the South Korean context. Using two culturally distinct samples, we demonstrate limitations to the generalizability of the original study’s findings and important constructs influencing continued-use intention across cultural boundaries.},

  abstract={U.S. emergency alert systems (EAS) run on legacy software with aging hardware and limited cybersecurity. While EASs are an essential component of the U.S. critical infrastructure, they are often under-funded, and workers frequently lack the knowledge to protect these systems adequately. Recent compromises of various EASs have not inspired public conﬁdence. We present a method for EAS authorities to engage with external cybersecurity researchers to ﬁnd, recover from, and disclose vulnerabilities using coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) policies. Clearly written CVD policies set guidelines and legal bounds for cybersecurity research, taking advantage of researcher expertise while working to strengthen the cybersecurity of the patchwork public-private-government networks comprising EASs. We intended to investigate the CVD policies of EASs in seven southeastern states; however, we could ﬁnd no CVD policies through the entire supply chain. Instead, we investigated the CVD policies of the top 10 technology ﬁrms on the Fortune 500 list, analyzing best practices in terms of publication of a CVD policy, as well as: setting eligibility requirements, describing the submission process, delineating researcher restrictions, outlining agreements on sharing credit, and explaining bounties (if relevant). We recommend that EAS authorities develop CVD policies in line with suggested criteria, using policies from top technology organizations combined with the proposed framework, and using cybersecurity researchers as a valuable component of the EAS supply chain.},
